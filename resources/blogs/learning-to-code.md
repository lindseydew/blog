Learning To Code

A lot of people ask me how I got 'into tech', and I never quite know how to respond because the answer is actually really simple.
I just applied for a trainee role in the field. It's true that of tech companies hire for transferable analytic skills and aptitude, rather than specific language skills, but most people I speak to seem to be surprised to hear I could learn to programme on the job.

It was a *steep* learning curve at the beginning, but after a while it started to fall into place and stopped feeling
like a complete mystery.

Here are the things that helped me overcome the learning hurdles:

**Programming courses:** there are so many free online courses from beginner to more advanced computer science. Doing a
couple of these helped me get a bit of practice programming, and gain more of an understanding of some of the core concepts
in computer science. [Coursera](https://coursera.org) helped me get the basics of Java and Scala.

**Work side project:** I took on a work side project to help me get more confident with coding.
This worked really well for me because the criteria was really well defined, the structure of the code had already been
written by an experienced developer, and there were people in the business that really wanted the work done.
Doing it outside of work meant I could take it at my own pace, and come back to the challenging bits later.
Having a good working knowledge of an entire smaller application helped me to understand the larger apps we work with day-to-day.

**Working in a work stream:** It was challenging being placed in a team with no specific programming language skill
or experience of doing any work like it before. It meant having to shadow team members and ask lots of questions whilst
trying not to distract them from their work too much. With no 'niche' or expertise, though, it gave me the opportunity
to work on all aspects of the project and consequently I have an understanding of the full technology stack now.
Having worked outside of my comfort zone for many months has made me less afraid to pick up work on tasks where I am
unfamiliar with the language/technologies. Probably the best 'programming' skill I have learned is how to go about
completing a task that I don't already know how to do.

**Asking people:** I have asked for help a lot, and received it. It can be a hard balance to strike in programming because
working things out for yourself is really important too. But I've found talking problems through with other developers
really valuable for understanding different ways of approaching a problem, and learning different techniques.

**Time:** The best way to learn a skill is to absorb yourself in it, and practice it. Often I have felt I'm not getting
very far with it, and then been surprised to suddenly find clarity in work I had found so opaque. I have learned heaps by simply going to work each day, discussing things with people, and completing my dev cards.

It's been several more months since I started to learn to code, and I'm still learning. But I'm often surprised to realise
I have skills that I can share with other programmers now too. I'm no expert, but I'm not a noob anymore either.

I think more should be done to communicate that the learning barriers for programming are not insurmountable with just a bit
of time, determination and the right level of support.
