Scala was the first server side language for web development that I was introduced to, and I was immediately intrigued.
The functional style of the language appealed to my mathsy side, and even on first glance, I
could see how expressive it could be. That said, I found it difficult to find learning materials on Scala that didn't
assume knowledge of at least one other programming language. Since Scala runs on the jvm and is compatible with Java libraries
I decided to start by learning a bit of Java first. With a bit of programming proficiency behind me, I found taking an
online course in Scala super valuable in getting to grips with the underlying building blocks to the language.

This course, [Functional Programming Principals in Scala](https://www.coursera.org/course/progfun) is re-running for the
third time starting September 16th. It is developed and delivered by creator of Scala, [Martin Ordersky](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Odersky)
and the course introduces ideas of functional programming, and how this can be combined with object orientated programming.
I think having a general grasp of programming is definitely useful for this course, though probably not essential for
the highly driven.

My colleague [@adamnfish](https://twitter.com/adamnfish) and I blogged about the course when we completed it last year.
We have put up instructions of [how to get started with IntelliJ](http://www.theguardian.com/info/developer-blog/2012/sep/21/funtional-programming-principles-scala-setting-up-intellij)
and [our first impressions](http://www.theguardian.com/info/developer-blog/2012/sep/21/funtional-programming-principles-scala-first-impressions). We give an update [midway through](http://www.theguardian.com/info/developer-blog/2012/oct/05/functional-programming-scala-week-three)
and our final thoughts [here](http://www.theguardian.com/info/developer-blog/2012/nov/02/functional-programming-scala-the-final-push).

I had a lot of fun doing the course, and it has certainly helped me get a better appreciation of how to apply
functional programming techniques into web development. I would definitely be interested in a follow up course, which
delves a little deeper into the internals of Scala, or one that sheds some light on [sbt](www.scala-sbt.org).

I'd recommend the course to anyone wanting to pick up Scala, or just interested in broadening their programming skills.
