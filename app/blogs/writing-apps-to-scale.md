Scaling with confidence

Writing software that works on 'my machine' versus writing software that just works are not the same thing. Hack days are proof that
devs can get a fairly decent application working in a day or even a couple of hours. But taking that piece of software, and
getting that to run smoothly for thousands or millions of users, on many variations of browsers, and suddenly it's a whole
different challenge.

Having worked on a couple of projects that have been required to work at scale, here are some of the few techniques and skills
I've picked up that go beyond just writing the code.


####Testing Strategies
*Cross browser test early:* Make sure your whole team understands which browsers are officially supported, and get everyone
rotating browser.

*Environment set up*: Get these set up early, and try to develop in a way that adds a fully working feature at a time.
Having a good sense of what should be working, and what isn't built yet can help catch regression bugs.


####Debugging Strategies
*Monitoring:* Make visible how many failed requests you're serving. If you're using Google App Engine, you'll have monitoring build in.
Otherwise it can be a little harder to get set up. But even something crude that just alerts failed requests can help give
some visibility of how your app is performing at scale.

*Know your logs:* Making sure your app logs useful messages at error points, and being confident about how to search through
your logs can make a big difference to resolving unexpected/peculiar issues quickly.

*Attaching Unique Header:* If your client's request needs to go through multiple services for a response, then even ascertaining
which app has a failure point can be difficult. Attaching a unique header to these requests at the first point of contact service,
and then logging this via all the services the request calls, can help trace these and spot the origin of the error. This can be
particularly useful in spotting the cause of slow responses.


####Testing in PROD

*Test data*: Regression testing your application in production on a small part of the site that users won't easily find can
illuminate issues you never thought would be a problem. Upon launch of a new app, we discovered our CDN network dropped posts with no content sent, which broke a couple of
buttons on our application.

*Invisible Load Testing*: Accurately simulating PROD load is tricky. There are so many variables to keep
consistent before you can have any confidence in your tests results; same hard wear, same level of traffic, same intervals
being hit. Chances are you'll run a test, get a set of results, then spend your time wondering whether it's telling you something,
or it's just the way the tests were ran. Better, if possible, to add a call to all existing prod traffic that hits your
application, but returns nothing to the user.

*Roll out slowly*: If possible release your software to a small section of your traffic initially whilst you gain confidence that
everything is working as it should. This makes rollback much less painful, and may highlight issues that testing within the office did not.


Test early, test often and have visibility of how your app is behaving.
