Scala eXchange 2013: Why Representation Matters

This week I attended the [Scala eXchange](http://skillsmatter.com/event/scala/scala-exchange-2013) conference. It was the first time I'd been to event of it's kind, and I found it was
a great opportunity to learn from some of the leading industry experts. Many of the talks covered aspects of the Akka
library, (which by happy coincidence was being covered  [Principles of Reactive Programming](https://www.coursera.org/course/reactive)
this week), and it was fascinating to learn more about how this design pattern both enables safe concurrency in a distributed system and seeing examples of how it can be
used in practice.

During the evening of the first day there was a Q&A session with panel of experts including [Victor Klang](https://twitter.com/viktorklang)
and [Jonas Bonar](https://twitter.com/jboner). The subject of gender diversity (or lack of) came up and it
made for some awkward discussion.  On the one hand, this conference is open to anyone that wants to attend. Who are we to force our community on
people that aren't that interested anyway? Maybe more education at school level would help to redress the balance
eventually. On the other hand, the gender ratio is so unbalanced it does seem indicate that there are barriers to access in this community.
Not just for women, but for anyone that hasn't had similar opportunities/introduction as other members.
We don't need to wait for a curriculum change to get people learning and engaged with Scala.

(There are other examples in which the turn out wasn't very representative, but since gender was the point that was
discussed that night, I'm going to use this is my example).

I'm not saying it is the responsibility of conference organisers to ensure there is a 'good balance' of attendees. The
people attending and speaking at these conferences should be there because they want to and/or because they have something
interesting to say. That, of course, should be the only criteria. Any effort to get in people just because they don't
fit a 'stereotype' is superficial, wrong and could be potentially damaging.

What I am advocating though, is to notice this distribution and question it.


####Why is the community so under-representative of women?
Well there are less women in IT generally. True, but 17% of our IT workforce are made up of women. I'm going to
take a generous estimate at maybe 5% of the attendees of this conference were women.


####Maybe women just aren't interested in Scala?
Maybe. But of the thousands of people that completed Martin Ordersky's course in
[Functional Programming Principals in Scala](https://www.coursera.org/course/progfun), I'd be shocked if the gender split
was as low as 5%.

####Why does it matter anyway?
Scala is growing rapidly. The number of Scala developer jobs in London has grown by 134% in the last 12 months.
Conference speakers noted just how much bigger the attendance was this year was compared to a few years ago.
There's a real demand for this skill now and if we don't match the supply with a diverse range of people we're
throwing away potential talent and the situation we have now will perpetuate.


####So what can be done?
Yeah. This one is tough to answer, and I think it's something that needs to be addressed at its core. In the same way that
you can't write a whole application and then tack on 'making it scalable' at the end, you can't run an event for the community
and do a quick 'representation' check. I'm confident there are people out there with the interest and aptitude required for functional programming, especially
as technology itself becomes more mainstream and more jobs open up. Maybe these people are already working in IT, maybe they're looking
for a career change or want a new hobby, but we need to be proactive in making these connections. Having community events pitched at different
levels could help encourage to get a broader mix of attendees and grow the next generation of Scala developers. Maybe it is a little up front effort, sure, but it doesn't
have to be all one way. Why not take a few simple problems from open source code bases (the ones that would be nice to fix,
but no one seriously working on it really has time for) and give these as exercises to people interested in learning
Scala? Accessibility shouldn't be seen necessarily as a 'cost'. Done properly you can include people that might not have had the opportunity
otherwise and get the benefits of having a broader range of skills working on some important problems.

It is not up to conference organisers to fix this. It's up to individuals in the community. Are you really comfortable
with the status quo? And if not, ask yourself, what can I do today that's going to make a difference to the representation
at the next conference in 2014. Or 2015. It's up to us to change things.
