Chatting To Students

Recently I went out to Birmingham University (where I graduated from) to speak to maths students about careers in technology.
It was fascinating to meet people in the same situation as me a few years ago. I really resonated with the students'
feelings of uncertainty about the future.

I was particularly struck by how much pressure the students were under to get started on their career. I guess a generation
ago, gaining a decent degree was pretty much a passport to a skilled job. Now nearly [half of recent grads have non-graduate jobs](http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/19/half-recent-uk-graduates-stuck-jobs-ons). What this means for the university institutions is greater pressure on staff and students to prepare
for industry. Schools are not only measured on the quality of their teaching, but also on what their students end up doing
6 months after graduation. The impression I got from staff was that they were keen to help the students get the foot in
the door, but they didn't particularly know about the options available outside of uni.

The students seemed to have a pretty skewed visibility of industry and saw only companies they had the resources to actively court
grads with their particular subject discipline or teaching as their post-uni options. It was difficult to convince the
students that actually recruiters weren't looking for a hard and fast set of requirements in their candidates, and actually
there are very few careers where a specific degree is an essential pre-requisite (medicine, dentistry excluded). Many of
the students I spoke to believed it was important that they decided their career path before graduating. Whilst I think it's good to encourage students to prepare for life outside of education, I think this needs to coincided
encourage students to have an open mind and try things. Stepping out of university and into working life is daunting enough
without being told you need to 'be immediately successful'.

What was encouraging though, was the genuine interest some of the students had for a career in technology, but many believed
the software engineering jobs would not be open to them. And it's absolutely true that there are heaps of skills required for the role
that you just won't get from a maths degree. But the types of thinking skills you cultivate in a maths degree
are so applicable to the ones you use all the time in tech, it seems a shame not to try and help bridge the gap between
the degree and industry skills.

With that in mind here is a list of top tips for recent grads looking to get into software, even in you haven't studied Computer Science.


1. Get a [Github](http://github.com) account. This is how many companies handle [version control](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control), but it can also be used as
a kind of portfolio of public projects you have worked on/contributed to. Put anything on there that you have worked on,
even if it is just coursework. An employer will value being able to see examples of any kind of work you have been doing
over perfection.

2. Do some programming courses. Head to [Coursera](https://coursera.org) for free ones. Of particular recommendation are
CS-101, Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python, Start-up Engineering and Functional Principles in Scala.


3. Find a tech [meet up](http://meetup.com) and meet other folk in the industry. Ask them what it's like and the kinds of skills they use

4. Do some research on [agile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development), and find out about how the software
development life cycle works in practice.

Don't be put off if you find it difficult in the beginning - it's a steep learning curve for anyone starting out. If
you find yourself enjoying the learning and the problem solving and wanting to understand more then it could a good career
choice for you.
