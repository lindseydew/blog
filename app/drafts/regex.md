Learning about regex

I need to understand how regular expressions work better.

+ -> matches once or more
* -> matches zero times or more

. -> matches anything

[0-9] -> matches a single character in a range
[0-9a-fA-F] -> can use more than one range. this matches one or more hex character
\d -> single character that is a digit
\w -> matches a "word character" (alphanumeric characters plus underscore)
\s -> matches a single whitespace character
| -> like an 'or'
