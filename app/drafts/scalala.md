Scalala

Scala was the first server side language for web development that I was introduced to.
I took one look, and thought, this language looks awesome! But I did also find it tricky to adopt.
For me, what makes scala so awesome to use as a programmer, also makes it hardest to get started.
It's cool because you reason about collections, rather an iterating through each piece of data.
